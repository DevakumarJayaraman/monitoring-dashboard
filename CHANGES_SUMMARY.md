## 2. VM Housekeeping Enhancement

### Changes Made:
- **Created**: Separate `HousekeepingModal.tsx` component
- **Implemented**: 3-step workflow (Initial ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Completed)
- **Added**: File system before/after comparison with dummy data

### Three-Step Workflow:

#### Step 1: Initial Analysis
- Shows risk level indicator (Low/Medium/High)
- Displays cleanup categories with file counts and sizes:
  - Temporary Files
  - Log Files (with age information)
  - Cache Files
  - Docker Images (if applicable)
- High-risk operations show warning message
- Estimated cleanup size displayed prominently

#### Step 2: Running Script
- Terminal-style output display
- Real-time progress indicators (animated spinners)
- Shows files being deleted:
  - Sample file paths for each category
  - Truncated lists with "... and X more" indicators
- Different colors for different operations:
  - Emerald for prompt ($)
  - Amber for operation descriptions
  - Slate for file paths

#### Step 3: Completion
- ‚úÖ Success indicator with checkmark
- **File System Comparison**:
  - Side-by-side Before/After view
  - Visual progress bars showing usage
  - Color-coded:
    - Red/Amber for high usage (Before)
    - Emerald for improved usage (After)
  - Shows space freed for each mount point
- **Cleanup Summary Table**:
  - Itemized breakdown by category
  - Total space reclaimed highlighted

### Dummy Data Generated:
**For Linux VMs**:
```
Temp Files: /tmp/session_xyz123.tmp, /tmp/cache_abc789.dat, etc.
Log Files: /var/log/app/app.log.2024-09-15.gz, /var/log/system.log.old, etc.
Cache Files: /var/cache/app/*.cache, /home/user/.cache/thumbnails/*, etc.
```

**For Windows VMs**:
```
Temp Files: C:\Temp\session_xyz123.tmp, C:\Windows\Temp\cache_abc789.dat, etc.
Log Files: C:\Logs\app.log.2024-09-15, C:\Logs\system.log.old, etc.
Cache Files: C:\ProgramData\Cache\*.cache, C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Temp\*, etc.
```

**File System Before/After Example**:
```
Mount: /
Before: 72.5 / 120 GB (60% used)
After: 68.2 / 120 GB (57% used)
Freed: ‚Üì 4.3 GB
```

## 3. Button Styling Improvements

### Remove Button:
- **Icon**: Warning triangle (‚ö†Ô∏è)
- **Colors**: Rose/Red gradient
- **Border**: rose-500/60 with glow effect
- **Shadow**: rose-500/20 on hover
- **Font**: Semibold with improved readability

### Housekeeping Button:
- **Icon**: Beaker/Filter flask
- **Colors**: Amber/Orange gradient
- **Border**: amber-500/60 with glow effect
- **Shadow**: amber-500/20 on hover
- **Font**: Semibold with improved readability

### Button Positioning:
- Aligned in card header
- Responsive design (hides text on small screens, shows icon only)
- Consistent spacing and sizing

## 4. Technical Implementation

### New Files Created:
1. **`HousekeepingModal.tsx`**
   - Standalone modal component
   - Exports types: `HousekeepingInfo`, `HousekeepingStep`
   - Fully self-contained with all three steps

### Modified Files:
1. **`InfrastructureView.tsx`**
   - Added Remove confirmation modal
   - Integrated HousekeepingModal component
   - Enhanced button styling
   - Added handler functions for both modals

### Type Definitions:
```typescript
type HousekeepingInfo = {
  machineName: string;
  infraType: string;
  tempFiles: { count: number; size: string; files: string[] };
  logFiles: { count: number; size: string; oldestDays: number; files: string[] };
  cacheFiles: { count: number; size: string; files: string[] };
  dockerImages: { count: number; size: string; files: string[] };
  estimatedCleanupSize: string;
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  fileSystemBefore: { mount: string; used: number; total: number; usedPercent: number }[];
  fileSystemAfter: { mount: string; used: number; total: number; usedPercent: number }[];
};

type HousekeepingStep = 'initial' | 'running' | 'completed';
```

### State Management:
```typescript
// Remove Modal State
const [removeModal, setRemoveModal] = useState<{
  isOpen: boolean;
  machine: InfraDetail | null;
}>({ isOpen: false, machine: null });

// Housekeeping Modal State
const [housekeepingModal, setHousekeepingModal] = useState<{
  isOpen: boolean;
  machine: InfraDetail | null;
  info: HousekeepingInfo | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  step: HousekeepingStep;
}>({
  isOpen: false,
  machine: null,
  info: null,
  isLoading: false,
  step: 'initial',
});
```
