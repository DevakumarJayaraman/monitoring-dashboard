# React Tailwind Starter

A minimal React + Tailwind CSS starter powered by Vite and TypeScript.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - start a development server with hot module replacement.
- `npm run build` - create an optimized production build.
- `npm run preview` - preview the built app locally.
- `npm run lint` - run ESLint using the flat config shipped with Vite.

## Styling

Tailwind CSS is configured via `tailwind.config.js` with source scanning for files in `src/` and `index.html`. Global styles live in `src/index.css`.

## TypeScript

`tsconfig.app.json` powers the app build while `tsconfig.node.json` keeps tooling configs typed. Ambient Vite types are declared in `src/vite-env.d.ts`.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start developing:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
