# Services View - Removed Top Right Action Button

**Date**: October 4, 2025

## Changes Made

Removed the "View Details" / "Selected" button from the top-right corner of service cards to create a cleaner, simpler interface.

### What Was Removed

**Before:**
- Each service card had a button in the top-right corner that displayed:
  - "View Details →" when not selected
  - "Selected ✓" when selected
- Button was clickable to toggle service selection
- Button stopped event propagation to allow clicking without triggering card click

**After:**
- No top-right action button
- Service cards remain fully clickable
- Selection state still visible through border/background styling
- Cleaner, less cluttered card design

### Visual Changes

**Before:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Payment Service      [View Details →] │
│                                        │
│ Description text...                    │
│ [Dev 3/5] [QA 2/3] [Prod 5/5]         │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Payment Service                        │
│                                        │
│ Description text...                    │
│ [Dev 3/5] [QA 2/3] [Prod 5/5]         │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Selection Indication

Service selection is still clearly visible through:
- **Border Color**: Changes from slate-800 to emerald-400/70 when selected
- **Background**: Changes from slate-900/70 to emerald-950/30 when selected
- **Shadow**: Adds emerald glow/shadow when selected
- **Ring**: Adds emerald-400/20 ring when selected
- **Icon Color**: Changes from emerald-300 to emerald-200 when selected

### Code Changes

**Removed:**
```tsx
topRightAction={
  <button
    type="button"
    className={`inline-flex items-center gap-1 transition ${
      isSelected 
        ? "text-emerald-200 hover:text-emerald-100 font-medium" 
        : "text-emerald-300 hover:text-emerald-200"
    }`}
    onClick={(event) => {
      event.stopPropagation();
      toggleServiceExpanded(service.profile, service.name);
    }}
  >
    {isSelected ? "Selected" : "View Details"}
    <span aria-hidden>{isSelected ? "✓" : "→"}</span>
  </button>
}
```

**Result:**
- Card component now has no `topRightAction` prop
- Cleaner JSX structure
- Reduced complexity

### Benefits

1. **Cleaner Design**: Less visual clutter on service cards
2. **Simpler Interaction**: Entire card is clickable without confusion
3. **Visual Feedback Sufficient**: Border/background changes clearly indicate selection
4. **Reduced Redundancy**: Button text was redundant with click action
5. **More Space**: Additional room for service information
6. **Faster Scanning**: Users can scan cards more quickly without extra UI elements

### User Interaction

**Before:**
- Click card body OR click "View Details" button to select
- Two clickable areas could cause confusion

**After:**
- Click anywhere on card to select
- Single, clear interaction model
- Visual feedback (emerald border/glow) indicates selection
