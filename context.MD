# React Frontend Quick Context

## Stack
- React 18 + Vite + TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS  
- React Router v6  
- Context API (or Redux if needed)  
- React Hook Form for forms  
- Application Path:/Users/rekhadevakumar/Desktop/workspace/frontend-samples/monitoring-dashboard

---

## Rules
- Functional components + hooks only  
- File naming: Components → PascalCase, hooks → useX, files → kebab-case  
- Always type props & API responses  
- Use async/await with try/catch for API calls  
- Keep Tailwind classes clean, extract repeated styles
- reuse components  
- frontend always build from /frontend from Application Path
